He followed it with a role opposite Vijayakanth in Senthoorapandi (1993). Vijay went on to play lead roles in his father's directorial ventures such as Rasigan (1994), Deva (1995) and Vishnu (1995).

        Vijay began the new millennium with critically and commercially successful films such as Kushi and Priyamaanavale. The following year, he appeared in three films: Friends, Badri and Shahjahan. All three were box office successes.[12][13][14] Many of his subsequent films were successful including Thamizhan,[14] Youth,[15] Bagavathi (all three released in 2002), and Vaseegara (2003). The success of his masala film Thirumalai (2003),[18] changed his on-screen persona to that of an action hero. He appeared next as a kabaddi player in Ghilli (2004), which went on to become the most commercially successful Tamil film of the year. His performance as a sword-smith in the masala film Thirupaachi (2005) earned him a special prize at the Tamil Nadu State Film Awards. He continued to achieve commercial success with Sivakasi (2005) and Pokkiri (2007). Barring Vettaikaaran and Kuruvi's box office successes,[25] his subsequent releases Azhagiya Tamil Magan (2007), where he played dual roles for the first time in his career,and Villu (2009) were average successes; his 50th film, Sura (2010), managed to recover only its production cost.
